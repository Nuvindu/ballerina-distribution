# Object

The `object` type is a separate basic type. An `object` value has named methods and fields which are in the same symbol space.
A `class` defines an `object` type and provides a way to construct an object. Apply the `new` operator with a `class` to get an object. Obejct methods can be called using `obj.foo(args)` and object fields can be accessed using `obj.x`.
